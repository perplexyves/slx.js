## 1 - Quickstart âš™

### A) Installation
#### Through *npm*:

```bash
npm i -D slx.js
```

(OR the longer one: `npm install --save-dev slx.js`)

#### Through *yarn*:

If you're not an npm user, you could use yarn:

```bash
yarn add -D slx.js
```

Slx.js is a development package; it is meant to help you locally. That's why we recommend you to install it as a dev dependency.

### B) Link to your website

Once the library installed (in node_modules folder), go to your main html file, then add in the `<head>` the following tag:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="dist/slx.min.css">
```

And in the end of the `<body>` add this:
```html
<script src="dist/slx.min.js"></script>
<script>
  Slx.init(); // Initialize Slx.js
</script>    
```
